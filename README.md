# OOPCA1

This Program was supposed to include 8 different functions:
Clock:
Supposed to tell the current time.

Custom Sliders:
Supposed to include three different sliders that would allow the user to customize the color of the window to their liking

Drive:
Supposed to manipulate the window to show the stars shaking/jittering to simulate the ship driving, 
the lever contained would have been mapped to the speed the stars shook.

Map:
Was going to be a small graphic of the ship heading in a particular direction.

Radar:
Was going to have a radar that would send out a pulse whenever the user clicked it.

Shutter:
Was going to allow the user to press a button and this would close a shutter down over the window and make everythign ojn the screen slightly darker.

Star:
Works, reads in a csv file with certain attributes for the stars on the screen

Window:
Works, just displays the window on the screen.

One thing that is fully working is that the whole display should be completely dynamic, regardless of screen size.
